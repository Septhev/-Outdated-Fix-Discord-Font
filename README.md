# Fix-Discord-Font
This is to revert back to a nicer discord font, why? CUZ GG SANS LOOK TERRIBLE. 
I got most of the code from @TheCommieAxolotl#0001 so this wouldn't have been done without his awesome coding. I got it from his theme called Ultra!
You can get this theme here: https://thecommieaxolotl.github.io/BetterDiscord-Stuff/Ultra
Anyways, I hope this solves the font problem and you guys enjoy! Have fun!!!
